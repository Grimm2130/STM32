Embedded Driver Development

1) Map out the Base addresses of the following
	- SRAM (1 & 2)
	- FLASH
	- ROM
	- BUSES (AHB & APB)
	- PERIPHERALS (GPIOs, Camera, e.t.c)
	
2) Create Sturctures for the peripherals, Where the sttructures will be used to
	interface with the internal registers of the peripherals.
