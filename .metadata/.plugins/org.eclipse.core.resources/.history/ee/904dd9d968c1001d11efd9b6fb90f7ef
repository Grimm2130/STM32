Embedded Driver Development

1) Map out the Base addresses of the following
	- SRAM (1 & 2)
	- FLASH
	- ROM
	- BUSES (AHB & APB)
	- PERIPHERALS (GPIOs, Camera, e.t.c)
	
2) Create Sturctures for the peripherals, Where the sttructures will be used to
	interface with the internal registers of the peripherals.
	
3) Define a Configurations structure to hold the pin configs

4) Define a Handler struct to encapsulate the Register addressing struct 
	and the configuration struct.

5) Define the API to interact with the peripherals. For the given peripherals, the following should be implemented
	
	- GPIOx
		* Initialize (Set base addr)
		* En/dis -able clock
		* Read from pin
		* Write to pin
		* Configure alternate functionality
		* Handle interrupt
